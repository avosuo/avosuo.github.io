<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>The idea of Avosuo brings together three factors.</p>
<h2>Micronation</h2>
<p>The first is the <em>idea of micronation</em>. Avosuo started in late summer of 2016 as a closed Facebook group consisting of some people sharing (roughly) similar musical tastes (we're prog but not snobs! except when we feel like being snobs) who wished the explore different arts, as well as simply trade stories and have fun. The name, which is in Finnish, means "open marsh", evoking an image of something extending very widely, as well as going deeply beneath. At some point, the members started to assume tongue-in-cheek pseudonyms and titles of nobility, and from there it was a just a small step of declaring Avosuo as an <a href="https://micronations.wiki/">independent micronation</a>. So this is the first factor and the historical basis for the rest of the project.</p>
<h2>"Cryptoland"</h2>
<p>The second factor, and this is where it starts to become something quite innovative and special, is the <i>cryptographically secured ownership of virtual real estate</i>, which can be bought and sold on open market. Instead of holding "natural" land (made of molecules), Avosuo is built on "land" in cyberspace measured in "acres" that is generated and transferred using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency
">peer-to-peer cryptocurrency technology</a> (such as Bitcoin). The details of how it works can be quite complex, but here is a basic rundown: At the heart of the system is a distributed database called "blockchain". Think of it as a ledger that holds a record of who owns how much land and where the land is situated. Everyone who runs a copy of the Avosuo software (technically similar to a Bitcoin wallet) as a "full node" (that is, it performs continual checks of land ownership) also holds a copy of the ledger locally on their machine. In other words, the system is not centralized, but is distributed among the peers. Every time land is being generated or bought/sold, the transaction is relayed via the internet among the peers and the ledger (blockchain) is updated accordingly. Every transaction is cryptographically signed and verified by full nodes, so the ownership is always secure by the consensus of the peer-to-peer network.</p>
<p>New land is generated principally by exactly the same process as new bitcoins are generated, known as "mining". Mining nodes are engaged in solving a tricky mathematical problem of gathering existing transactions into a "block" that fulfills certain formal requirements. The first node to find a solution (a block) is awarded with a specific amount of land, and the block together with its transactions is verified and recorded in the blockchain by the nodes. Over the time, the land reward decreases and the difficulty of the mining increases, so there is a finite amount of land that can be created. The other way of creating land is by fiat (this is known in the cryptocurrency world as "premine"), which is done only three times in total. First, at the very first block (the "genesis block"), a plot of land (the "genesis land") is assigned to the Treasury of Avosuo (which is responsible for the technical development) which then distributes it to the members of the Avosuo FB group, who are the original inhabitants of the micronation. Roughly an year afterwards, a half of that amount of acres are given to the treasury, and after two years, a quarter of the original amount are generated in the same way. These three special creations of new land "belonging to the crown" are used to finance the development and infrastructure (servers etc), and they are the only source of income to the treasury (there will be no taxes). Every other creation of land happens by mining in the network. </p>
<p>
<h2>Virtual reality</h2>
The third factor makes the project very unique and cutting-edge; <i>the virtual reality representation of the land, and the ability to build and develop on it</i>. This aspect relies on <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a>, a new technology that makes it possible to create virtual immersive environments embedded in plain webpages, and capable of being presented in most modern web browsers. The virtual reality itself is rendered on a sufficiently powerful mobile phone encased in a headset such as <a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/">Google Cardboard</a>.</p> 
<p>The VR presentation of cryptoland is made possible by inserting into the land-creating transactions data containing the coordinates of the new plot of land created. Transactions that transfer the ownership contain in addition the identity of the user to whom the ownership is transferred. Also data specifying whether the land is "open" of "closed" (no trespassing) is stored in the blockchain. The buildings and other real estate developments in Avosuo are HTML files that have been cryptographically signed by the private key belonging to the owner. These files can be relayed to the phone browser either from a IP address belonging to a node that is being run by the owner, if s/he so chooses, or from a public repository (an ordinary web server) where it has been uploaded. In case of "open" land, if no associated html file is found, the viewer renders a generic scene (such as a meadow or forest). In case of "closed" land, a stone wall is displayed. The closed land is accessible by requesting a signed HTML page directly from the owner and storing it locally. </p>

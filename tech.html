<h2>Design draft</h2>
  
<pre>
**Fenland and Fencoin

Fenland will exist on a finite plane and the order in which the government will grant the plots (i.e. mining) 
goes along Ulam's spiral.
Each plot is identified by its number in the spiral, translatable to x,y-coordinates in virtual space. 
Plots are transferred using Fencoin. They, together with fencoin will be generated by partaking in securing the 
network and producing blocks.

**Proof of stake

Fencoin will be implemented with pure proof-of-stake (Peercoin).
 We test the fundamental idea of proof-of-stake by committing ourselves to the notion that the network security 
 will be provided by the shared interest in the project rather than astringent cryptography. Treasury will publish checkpoints,
 but everyone is free to sync with evryone else.

Person who purchases either Fencoin or a plot of Fenland, becomes a fen-defender (upholder of proof-of-stake security). 
Fen-defenders are granted more land and coins by the government in a periodic lottery (of getting the privilege 
of producing a proof-of-stake block), where an amount of coins and one plot of land are awarded (as block rewards). 

There is a limit to the amount of generated money, which happens by halving the coin reward periodically. 
Also a limit the expansion of land to its max (MAX_PLOTS) exists. 
After that no land will be granted and fen-defenders are rewarded with fees only.

**Fencoin plot transaction.

GRANT OF PLOT
Generated always together with the coinbase. An output with unique script 
OP_N n, 
where N is the position on the spiral.
References a position in the spiral, translatable to 2D coordinates, a plot of land in VR. No fees.

TRANSFER OF PLOT
Input references a grant output in the blockchain. Transaction fees collected by fen-defender.

BUILD ON PLOT
Output with unique script that references external filesystem.

OP_N n OP_PUSH hash1 hash2,

where the hashes of display data files are referenced. 
Network fees. Revenue of the Crown that will be phased out by directing a growing percentage to a burn address.

details;
The other hash ("outside") references a texture file that defines the outward appearance of the box on the plot. 
How it looks to outside. 
The other hash ("inside") references data describing the scene that is rendered when one enters the building.
The client requests file from a server (a list is provided separately). 

Implementing these special transaction types will follow the example of Namecoin.

**The VR scene

A webserver running a node can serve web pages with A-Frame scripts that render scene using blockchain data.
By entering the plot coordinates into webpage, a view centered on that plot corner will be rendered. 
Display data hashes are fetched from node's plot database (analogous to UTXO db). The data is cached in browser.

Then A-frame is prepared, showing 4 nearest houses, in case a building has been erected. If not, render generic "grassland".
We keep changing the webpage DOM dynamically as the avatar changes its position, reading texture from cache and refreshing cache at intervals.
User enters a building by clicking it, and the "inside" script is then prepared and rendered. 

**Prototyping

We start off development with a prototype that consists of a web server that communicates with a node running 
a test chain (on a bitcoin clone using OP_RETURN for storing data) and prepares A-frame scenes based on the data.

Also, devs will familiarize themselves with Peercoin and Namecoin and their offshoots.

Investigation into micronational culture & procedures will be strongly encouraged.

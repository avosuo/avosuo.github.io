<h1>The Nation of Avosuo - The Vision</h1>
<p>After entering the address on the phone's browser, Alice slips her mobile device into the virtual reality headset and dons it. In a moment she is transported into the magical kingdom of Avosuo.</p>
<p>She finds herself in the Genesis Square, which is the place where new visitors usually arrive. It is crowded with avatars whose appearances range from ordinary humans to outlandish creatures. Around the square are large houses that look vaguely medieval, yet futuristic - the administrative buildings of Avosuo. Somehow their appearance brings to Alice's mind the sleeves of the "prog" records her uncle is so fond of.</p>
<p>For some time Alice just keeps standing there, observing the scene and the people in it. The immersion into this strange new world is so convincing that she is a little afraid to move, lest she becomes giddy or the illusion breaks somehow. But at length she turns and takes some tentative steps along the street leading away from the square. </p>
<p>Along the way, she passes more buildings. Upon them, as if written in the sky, are the names of the inhabitants who own the estate on which they are built. Some of the buildings have open doorways and she can see people entering and coming out. Others are not open to public and show nothing but solid stone walls. She also sees a nice park with trees and fountains, as well as a green fenced pasture with "FOR SALE" sign on it. Finally she arrives in front of a round building looking like the Roman Pantheon. Over the door, a text says "ZAPHIOD'S ART GALLERY". After hesitating a little, she steps inside. </p>
<p>What she finds there does really look like a regular art gallery. A large clean room with tastefully arranged set of pictures on the walls. To add to the atmosphere, there is even a table with some glasses on it. Inspecting a glass, Alice sees that it is filled with a yellowish liquid with a small stream of bubbles arising from its bottom to the surface. Impressed with such a meticulous detail, but having no idea how to drink from it, Alice turns her attention to the paintings. There are about dozen of them, and underneath each one is a plaque that displays the title of the painting, plus some information as to whether the original is available for sale. Suddenly Alice gets an idea.</p>
<p>It so happens that Alice makes ambient electronica music. Currently it is a labour of love, but perhaps some day she could make a living of it. Maybe she could have a house of her own here in Avosuo where to host her music files... where to promote a CD... maybe even sell merchandise? The possibility excites her tremendously. Also she is getting a little bit of tired, as she's not accustomed of spending time so long in virtual reality. Time to sign off and think about it.</p>
<p>On that same evening she downloads a copy of the official Avosuo client software. She also goes to a cryptocurrency exchange and purchases a 200 acres of land, which are instantly registered on the blockchain as belonging to her and ready to be developed further. All inhabitants running the client software now unanimously acknowledge her as a new inhabitant of the Nation Of Avosuo, with "Margarita De Audiophlang" as her new identity. Next she learns a little VR design, and with online tools she is able to construct her own building to house her creations. Soon, not only does she run a music store of her own, she also regularly performs live gigs at Avosuo to the great delight of her fellow citizens!</p>

<p>By now you are probably wondering how all this is supposed to work? <a href="how.html">Proceed to read a general outline answering that very question.</a></p>
